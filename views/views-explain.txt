Here I put the things that are unique to the page. for example

views/user/home.handlebars:

<div>
    Welcome, user! Here's your dashboard.
</div>

this is what is put inside the {{BODY}} in the main handlebars.

a typical structure:

views/
│
├── layouts/
│   ├── userLayout.handlebars     (Main layout for regular users)
│   └── adminLayout.handlebars    (Main layout for administrators)
│
├── partials/ 
│   ├── section1.handlebars       (First consistent section)
│   └── section2.handlebars       (Second consistent section)
│
├── user/
│   ├── home.handlebars           (User-tailored Home page view)
│   └── about.handlebars          (User-tailored About page view)
│
└── admin/
    ├── home.handlebars           (Admin-tailored Home page view)
    └── about.handlebars          (Admin-tailored About page view)
